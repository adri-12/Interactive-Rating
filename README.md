 A React function component called "Rating". It uses the useState hook to manage the state of the component. The state consists of two variables: selectedRating and isSubmitted.

The selectedRating variable is used to keep track of the user's selected rating, while the isSubmitted variable is used to keep track of whether the form has been submitted or not. The useState hook is called twice, once for each variable, to initialize the state with the value of null for selectedRating and false for isSubmitted.

The component has two functions: 

handleRatingClicked and handleFormSubmitted

The handleRatingClicked function is called when the user clicks on a rating button, and it updates the state by calling setSelectedRating with the selected rating as the argument. 
The handleFormSubmitted function is called when the form is submitted, and it updates the state by calling setIsSubmitted with the value true.

The component returns different elements based on the value of isSubmitted.
If the form has been submitted, the component returns a div that contains an image and a text "Thank You".
If the form has not been submitted, the component returns a form that allows the user to select a rating and submit the form. The form has several buttons that represent the ratings, an image, a header, a paragraph, and a submit button. 
The handleRatingClicked function is passed as a callback to each rating button's onClick event, so that the state is updated when the button is clicked. The handleFormSubmitted function is passed as a callback to the form's onSubmit event, so that the form is submitted when the user clicks the submit button.
